Note that, it has terrible performeance because the data is bad. We can fix it by making new data, easily. And it would not change the REST api in any manner so feel free to use this endpoint in your code. We will update our underlying model soon.

Additionally, frontend-backend interaction requires 2-3s to happen so the sign recognition no longer remains live. We need to think about it and find a way around it.
